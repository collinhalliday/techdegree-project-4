# TIC TAC TOE Game and AI

A tic tac toe game that allows two users to play against each other, or one user to play against un unbeatable AI.

This project was done in conjunction with my TeamTreehouse full-stack JavaScript TechDegree, as the fourth project of twelve. Starter html and css files were provided for me, along with mockups of what the page should look like for various game states(i.e. win, lose, tie). I was tasked with programming the game's functionality, associated manipulations of the html based on the particular player's turn or the game state reached, and as extra credit, programming the unbeatable AI opponent.

## Installation:

Download the project files.
